As I mentioned in the home page, my name is Alejandro Catalina, raised and born in Madrid, Spain.
I am currently a PhD student in bayesian statistics at Aalto University, working under the supervision of [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) since March 2019.

I studied a Bachelors in Computer Science at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. In my final year I joined the [Machine Learning Group](http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~gaa/) to work with [José R. Dorronsoro Ibero](https://portalcientifico.uam.es/ipublic/agent-personal/profile/iMarinaID/04-259712) for my bachelors thesis, titled _Data Analytics on Renewable Energies: Organization and Analysis of Radiation Satellite Measures_.

After graduation I went on to study a Masters in Machine Learning at the same university and with the same supervisor, that ended with the masters thesis [Nesterov Acceleration Schemes for Group Lasso](https://repositorio.uam.es/bitstream/handle/10486/681033/Catalina_Feliu_Alejandro_tfm.pdf?sequence=1), where I developed some theory in the field of Convex Optimization to accelerate convergence.

In October 2017 I joined the PhD program at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid in machine learning. 
After an interesting first year I joined the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk) at Cambridge University as a visiting doctoral student, working under the supervision of [José Miguel Hernández Lobato](https://jmhl.org), where I became interested in Bayesian methods. 

Upon coming back to Spain I started working on a side project with José Miguel's brother, [Daniel Hernández Lobato](https://dhnzl.org), who is a professor in the same department I was doing the PhD at. 
<!-- In this project we developed a spike and slab model for multiclass classification using expectation propagation for inference, of which an abstract (work in progress) was accepted at the BISP (Bayesian Inference in Stochastic Processes) workshop in June 2019. -->

A few months later and after I got news of some openings at the [Probabilistic Machine Learning Group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) I got in touch with Aki, who accepted me to become his student, and here I am!
