As I mentioned in the home page, my name is Alejandro Catalina, raised and born in Madrid, Spain.
I am currently a PhD student in bayesian statistics at Aalto University, working under the supervision of [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) since March 2019.

I studied a Bachelors in Computer Science at Universidad Aut\'onoma de Madrid. In my final year I joined the [Machine Learning Group](http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~gaa/) to work with [Jos\'e R. Dorronsoro Ibero](https://portalcientifico.uam.es/ipublic/agent-personal/profile/iMarinaID/04-259712) for my bachelors thesis, titled _Data Analytics on Renewable Energies: Organization and Analysis of Radiation Satellite Measures_.

After graduation I joined the Masters programme in Machine Learning at Universidad Aut\'onoma de Madrid, which I finished with the masters thesis [Nesterov Acceleration Schemes for Group Lasso](https://repositorio.uam.es/bitstream/handle/10486/681033/Catalina_Feliu_Alejandro_tfm.pdf?sequence=1) under Jos\'e R. Dorronsoro as well, where I developed some theory in the field of Convex Optimization to accelerate convergence of FISTA, a popular proximal optimization algorithm that is suited to minimize convex functions with non differentiable components.

In October 2017 I joined the PhD program at Universidad Aut\'onoma de Madrid in machine learning, working around proximal methods and convex optimization. 
After an interesting first year I joined the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk) at Cambridge University as a visiting doctoral student, working under the supervision of [Jos\'e Miguel Hern\'andez Lobato](https://jmhl.org), where I became interested in Bayesian methods. 

Upon my come back to Spain I started working on a side project with [Daniel Hern\'andez Lobato](https://dhnzl.org), who is a professor in the same department I was doing the PhD at. 
<!-- In this project we developed a spike and slab model for multiclass classification using expectation propagation for inference, of which an abstract (work in progress) was accepted at the BISP (Bayesian Inference in Stochastic Processes) workshop in June 2019. -->

A few months later and after I got news of some openings at the [Probabilistic Machine Learning Group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) I got in touch with Aki, who accepted me to become his student, and here I am! 
I am currently pursuing my PhD working in several topics involving Bayesian methods, Bayesian variable and structure selection and robust Variational Inference.

## Hobbies
I have a very broad variety of hobbies that I enjoy full of passion, these include but are not limited to (in any particular order):

  - Real Madrid CF (football).
  - Tennis (playing and watching).
  - Reading, specially fantasy genre (lord of the rings, a song of ice and fire, malazan: the book of the fallen, etc).
  - Watching sports in general.
  - Chess.
  - Food, I love food and everything surrounding it, from very fancy and classy to the good ol' classics.
  - Computer science and programming languages in general, I have a big love for functional programming languages (Lisp, Haskell, I haven't had a close look at Ocaml yet but it's on my list).

If you share any of these passions and are up for a discussion on any of these or other fun topics, reach out!
