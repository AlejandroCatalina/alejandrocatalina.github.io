I am always very happy to talk about teaching, specially advising students (bachelors or masters level), so please get in touch if any of my work seems interesting to you!

My teaching duties at Aalto involve being a TA for Aki's Bayesian Data Analysis course, during the following years:

  1. *Fall 2020*, around 400 students.
  2. *Fall 2019*, around 300 students.

As a PhD Student at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid I got the chance to TA for the department of Computer Science, instructing the following courses:

  1. **Software Engineering**, *Spring 2019*. This is an undergraduate level course of which I taught the lab assignments sessions, 2 hours a week to 2 different groups of about 30 students.
  2. **Software Engineering**, *Spring 2018*. This is an undergraduate level course of which I taught the lab assignments sessions, 2 hours a week to 2 different groups of about 30 students.
