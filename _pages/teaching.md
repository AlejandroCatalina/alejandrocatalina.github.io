I am always very happy to talk about teaching, specially advising students (bachelors or masters level), so please get in touch if any of my work seems interesting to you!

As a PhD Student at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid I got the chance to TA for the department of Computer Science, instructing the following courses:

  1. **Software Engineering**, *Spring 2019*. This is an undergraduate level course of which I taught the lab assignments sessions, 2 hours a week to 2 different groups of about 30 students.
  2. **Software Engineering**, *Spring 2018*. This is an undergraduate level course of which I taught the lab assignments sessions, 2 hours a week to 2 different groups of about 30 students.
