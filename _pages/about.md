In this personal web site you will find a short summary of my research interests, project notes, and other activities that interest me at the time of writing. 
If you ever want to get in touch, please do not hesitate to do so! 
I am always very happy to talk about various topics, from science to other more general concepts.

In short, my work is focused around the development of new methods within the Bayesian Statistics framework.
These range from doing feature selection to developing new inference approaches for Bayesian computation.
All of these can be understood from the perspective of developing a robust and more automated workflow for Bayesian modeling and reasoning.

One of my current projects focuses on extending and developing [projpred](https://github.com/stan-dev/projpred.git), an R package to perform Bayesian feature selection over a reference model. 
On another project, a colleague and I are implementing [Differentially deep Gaussian processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04066), a very interesting paper that models the dynamics of a stochastic system with a Gaussian Process.
You can find out more details taking a look at my [CV](http://alejandrocatalina.github.io/files/alejandro_catalina_CV.pdf).
